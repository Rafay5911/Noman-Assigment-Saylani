    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Mountains are majestic landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, often characterized by steep slopes, high peaks, and dramatic landscapes. Formed through powerful geological processes such as tectonic plate movements and volcanic activity, mountains can take millions of years to shape. They are found on every continent and play a vital role in influencing climate, providing freshwater through glaciers and rivers, and supporting diverse ecosystems. Mountains are not only natural wonders but also hold cultural, spiritual, and recreational significance for people around the world, offering a unique blend of beauty, challenge, and inspiration.</p>
